# cloud.me
Cloud.me is an Android based proxy browser that allows users to surf the internet without displaying Flash and JavaScript. This "secret" browser also does not save cookies, history, downloads, or display your IP address. It simply changes your IP address every time a new tab is opened or a new website is searched for. Each tab uses a separate IP address.
